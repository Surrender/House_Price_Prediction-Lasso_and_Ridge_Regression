# House_Price_Prediction-Lasso_and_Ridge_Regression
A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market. The objective of the analysis is to build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.
